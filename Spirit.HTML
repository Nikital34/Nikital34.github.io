        <p id=info> It doesn't matter what religious background you were raised in or lack of, spirituality is the practice and belief that there is something greater than self. Our goal is to care for the better of the entire universe rather than the small materialistic goals or objects here on earth. Within the vast ideals of spirituality, there are many different practices from countless religions that are used to ground and evaluate self. In this section we will explore these practices, their benefits, and how to do them. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3 id=subhead>Mindfulness Meditation</h3>
        <p id= info>Mindful Meditation is the practice of allowing your thoughts to come and go. Your main goal is to accept and observe these thoughts instead of trying to control and banish them. Watch your thoughts for a third person perspective and take notes of any patterns.</p>
        <br />
        <h3 id=subhead>Zen Meditation</h3>
        <br />
        <p id= info>Zen Meditation draws the minds attention to the body’s breath. Your breath should follow a direction. Your inhale should fill your stomach going down into the body and your exhale flowing up and out of the body. Your mind's focus should be on the flow of your breath entering and exiting your body.</p>
        <h3  id=subhead>Focused Meditation</h3>
        <br />
        <p id= info>Focused Meditation brings your mind’s attention to a particular object,sensation,or sound instead of trying to limit the mind's thoughts.</p>
        <h3 id=subhead>How to Meditate for beginners</h3>
        <p id= info2><b>1.</b> Begin with taking a seated position. This could be in a chair or on the floor.</p>
        <br />
        <p id= info2><b>2a. Floor Position</b> Use a cushion to raise your hips above your knees. There are many kinds of seated positions such as burmese and full lotus, but for now we will do the quarter lotus (to achieve more complex positions, please look into yoga for flexibility.) The quarter lotus is the criss cross applesauce position.Your back should be straight along with your neck. Tuck your chin towards  your chest Make a circle with your hands and rest them in your lap.</p>
        <br />
        <p id= info2><b>2b. Chair Position</b> Find a comfortable chair. Sit on the edge of the chair with your back straight not touching the back of the chair. Make sure your feet are flat on the ground. Make a circle with your hands and rest them in your lap. The feet on the floor receive energy from the ground. The energy circulates around your body during meditation.</p>

<p  id= info2><b>3.</b> Rest your eyes and begin to slow your breath and start a rhythm. To achieve this start with the fourfold breath.</p>
        <ol>
                <li id="bulletpoints">Inhale for four counts</li>
                <li id="bulletpoints">Hold breath for four counts</li>
                <li id="bulletpoints">Exhale for four counts</li>
                <li id="bulletpoints">Hold for four counts</li>
                <li id="bulletpoints">Repeat</li>
        </ol>
<br />
<p id= info2><b>4.</b> Once a rhythm is present, choose one of three meditations provided above to start.</p>
<br />
<p id= info2><b>5.</b> As a beginner, you may only be able to hold your focus or position for a few minutes. This is okay, try to build your time incrementally, but don’t let your time rule over your moment of peace.</p>
<br />
<p id= info2><b>6.</b> I urge beginners to keep a journal documenting your thoughts and feelings during meditation.</p>
