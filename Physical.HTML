          <p id="subhead"><b>Workout Plan</b></p>
          <p id="info">A good workout plan for starters is the push and pull days strategy. You switch between them every time you go to the gym, so that you can work everything out and not have to deal with your muscles being sore. Push days are when you push with your upper body, prioritizing chest, triceps, and shoulders. Pull days are ones where you pull with your upper body, prioritizing back and biceps. Leg/Ab days are the third day in this cycle, and as the name suggests you do abdominal and leg workouts on this day. Switching between the three every day and you got yourself a great workout plan!</p>
